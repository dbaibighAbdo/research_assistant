# research_assistant

##### ******  this is a graph based workflow built with (LangGraph/LangChain)  ******

Our goal is to build a lightweight, multi-agent system around chat models that customizes the research process.

`Source Selection` 
* Users can choose any set of input sources for their research.
  
`Planning` 
* Users provide a topic, and the system generates a team of AI analysts, each focusing on one sub-topic.
* `Human-in-the-loop` will be used to refine these sub-topics before research begins.
  
`LLM Utilization`
* Each analyst will conduct in-depth interviews with an expert AI using the selected sources.
* The interview will be a multi-turn conversation to extract detailed insights as shown in the [STORM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14207) paper.
* These interviews will be captured in a using `sub-graphs` with their internal state. 
   
`Research Process`
* Experts will gather information to answer analyst questions in `parallel`.
* And all interviews will be conducted simultaneously through `map-reduce`.

`Output Format` 
* The gathered insights from each interview will be synthesized into a final report.
* We'll use customizable prompts for the report, allowing for a flexible output format.

pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Set up environment variables
Create a .env file in the root directory and configure the necessary environment variables.

ðŸ’¡ Example:
---- .env.example ----

4. Run the Research Assistant
Start the assistant with:

```bash
python research_assistant.py
```

5. Enable Tracing with LangSmith
LangSmith helps trace and debug your agents effectively.
Check out the:

[tracing](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/concepts/tracing).

6. (Optional) Use LangGraph Studio
You can launch an interactive development studio for LangGraph using:

```bash
langgraph dev
```
